# Heart Failure Model Prediction

Machine learning models built to predict heart failure outcomes using clinical data.

## Project Overview

This repository provides implementations and experiments of various ML algorithms on a heart failure dataset (918 clinical records with 11–12 features). It focuses on:

- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Accuracy assessment with performance metrics

## Features

- Data preprocessing: handle missing values, encoding, normalization
- EDA: visualize correlations, distributions, and trends
- Model implementation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - LightGBM / CatBoost (depending on your implementation)
- 🚀 Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves

## Results

- Random Forest / LightGBM / CatBoost often scores ~90–91% accuracy
- KNN also demonstrates strong performance (~89% accuracy) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
